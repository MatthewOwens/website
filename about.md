# About Me

### Big Nerd, GameDev, Writing unhealthy amounts of C

I use computers a hell of a lot, and would much prefer if I had control over
what my computer's doing. This has led me down the linux rabbit-hole, and I now
much prefer it to whatever's going on above ground.

I like making games, with far too large a scope. As a result, I am currently
building out my own engine in C after escaping C++. Some of my earlier
[projects](https://owens.tech/projects) have been more immediately impressive
(i.e. playable), but I just grew to really dislike working in C++ and with other
people's libraries. I also really enjoy the fact that if I'm working with
straight C, and something *breaks* - it's going to be my fault.
That being said, I think I'll rely on OpenGL for graphics rendering. I'm not
quite that masochistic.

In terms of boring computing, I reluctantly work with AWS for my job and have a
certification that you can see on
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-owens-b86570153/) if that's your
cup of tea.

The best way to reach me is by [email](mailto:matthew@owens.tech).
